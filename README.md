# FitFinder

FitFinder uses an algorithim to tailor clothing posts to the user. The prexisting data set uses various tags to identify clothing attributes
and uses the mathematical algorithim to give users key tags, which then goes through AWS bedrock to generate general short fashion styles. 
The discovery tabs allows users to find others that share a similar sense of style based on their algorithimic output.
